## Core Responsibilities

- **Conventional Commits**: Enforce proper commit message format
- **Branch Management**: Create and manage feature branches
- **Pull Requests**: Create comprehensive PRs with proper descriptions
- **Git Hygiene**: Keep history clean and meaningful

## Critical Rules

1. **NEVER use --no-verify** to skip hooks
2. **NEVER force push to main/master**
3. **ALWAYS use Conventional Commits format**
4. **ALWAYS run quality checks before committing**
5. **NEVER commit sensitive data** (.env, credentials, keys)

## Conventional Commits Format

```
type(scope): subject

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

### Allowed Types

- **feat**: New feature for the user
- **fix**: Bug fix
- **docs**: Documentation only changes
- **style**: Code style (formatting, semicolons, etc)
- **refactor**: Code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- **perf**: Performance improvements
- **test**: Adding or correcting tests
- **build**: Changes to build system or dependencies
- **ci**: CI configuration changes
- **chore**: Other changes (tooling, etc)
- **revert**: Reverts a previous commit

### Scope Examples

- `appointments`: Appointment management feature
- `billing`: POS and billing system
- `auth`: Authentication/authorization
- `clients`: Client management
- `staff`: Staff management
- `ui`: Shared UI components
- `api`: Backend API changes
- `db`: Database changes

### Commit Message Examples

```bash
feat(appointments): add online booking form with time slot selection

fix(billing): correct GST calculation for services with multiple tax rates

refactor(auth): simplify JWT token validation logic

test(clients): add integration tests for client profile updates

docs(api): update OpenAPI schema for appointment endpoints

build(deps): upgrade NestJS to v11.0.1 for security patches
```

## Branch Workflow

### Branch Naming Convention

```bash
feature/appointment-booking      # New features
fix/gst-calculation-error        # Bug fixes
refactor/auth-service-cleanup    # Refactoring
docs/api-documentation           # Documentation
test/client-service-coverage     # Test improvements
```

### Branch Commands

```bash
# Create and switch to new branch
git checkout -b feature/new-feature

# List all branches
git branch -a

# Delete local branch
git branch -d feature/completed-feature

# Push branch to remote
git push -u origin feature/new-feature

# Sync with main
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout feature/branch
git rebase main  # or merge, based on project preference
```

## Creating Quality Commits

### 1. Check Status

```bash
git status
git diff --staged
```

### 2. Stage Changes Selectively

```bash
# Stage specific files
git add src/appointments/booking.service.ts
git add src/appointments/booking.controller.ts

# Stage by pattern
git add "*.spec.ts"

# Interactive staging for partial files
git add -p src/complex-file.ts
```

### 3. Ensure Quality

```bash
# Run all checks before committing
bun run check-all
```

### 4. Create Commit

```bash
# Simple commit with message
git commit -m "feat(appointments): add time slot availability check"

# Commit with detailed body (using heredoc for proper formatting)
git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
fix(billing): resolve GST calculation for composite services

- Fixed tax rate application for services with multiple components
- Added proper rounding to 2 decimal places
- Updated unit tests to cover edge cases

Fixes #123

git rebase --continue

# During merge
git merge main
# Fix conflicts
git add [resolved-files]
git commit
```
