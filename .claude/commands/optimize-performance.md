description: Run comprehensive performance audit and optimization across frontend and backend
---

Deploy performance optimization specialists to analyze and improve your application's performance:

**Performance Analysis Team (runs in parallel):**

1. **performance-optimizer**:
   - Analyzes React render cycles and re-renders
   - Identifies bundle size reduction opportunities
   - Reviews lazy loading implementation
   - Checks memory leaks and performance bottlenecks

2. **database-expert**:
   - Analyzes query performance with EXPLAIN
   - Identifies missing indexes
   - Reviews N+1 query problems
   - Suggests query optimizations

3. **frontend-specialist**:
   - Reviews component memoization
   - Checks for unnecessary re-renders
   - Validates code splitting strategy
   - Analyzes asset optimization

4. **backend-expert**:
   - Reviews API response times
   - Analyzes caching strategies
   - Checks for blocking operations
   - Validates connection pooling

The audit will provide:

- Lighthouse score improvements
- Bundle size reduction strategies
- Database query optimization plans
- API response time improvements
- Caching implementation recommendations
- Lazy loading opportunities
- Memory usage optimization

Output includes specific code changes and performance metrics before/after projections.
