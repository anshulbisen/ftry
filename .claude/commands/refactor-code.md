description: Orchestrate multiple refactoring specialists to improve code quality and maintainability
---

Deploy a team of refactoring specialists to systematically improve your codebase:

**Refactoring Team (sequential execution for maximum impact):**

**Phase 1 - Analysis (parallel):**

1. **code-duplication-detector**: Identify duplicate code patterns
2. **code-quality-enforcer**: Find type safety and quality issues
3. **module-boundaries**: Detect architectural violations

**Phase 2 - Planning:**

4. **nx-specialist**: Plan library extraction and reorganization
5. **senior-architect**: Review refactoring strategy

**Phase 3 - Implementation (parallel):**

6. **frontend-expert**: Refactor React components
   - Extract custom hooks
   - Create reusable components
   - Optimize component structure

7. **backend-expert**: Refactor NestJS modules
   - Extract services
   - Improve dependency injection
   - Standardize API patterns and DTOs

**Phase 4 - Quality Assurance:**

8. **code-quality-enforcer**: Ensure all quality gates pass
9. **test-guardian**: Update tests for refactored code

The refactoring will address:

- Code duplication elimination
- Type safety improvements
- Component/service extraction
- Library organization
- API standardization
- Test coverage maintenance
- Documentation updates

Output includes:

- Refactoring plan with priority order
- Specific code changes
- New library/component structures
- Updated import paths
- Test modifications needed

Usage: `/refactor-code [component|module|library|all]`
