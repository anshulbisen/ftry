# Reports Directory

This directory contains auto-generated reports from Claude Code agents and slash commands.

## Important

**Reports are NOT committed to git** - They are temporary artifacts for tracking work and should be archived after addressing action items.

See `.claude/DOCUMENTATION_STANDARDS.md` for complete documentation standards.

## Naming Convention

**Format**: `{category}-{subcategory}-{date}.md`

**Date Format**: `YYYY-MM-DD` (ISO 8601, sortable)

**Categories**:
- `sync` - Repository synchronization reports
- `review` - Code and architecture reviews
- `optimization` - Performance and code optimization
- `security` - Security audits and vulnerability reports
- `test` - Test coverage and quality reports
- `architecture` - Architectural analysis reports

**Examples**:
```
sync-repository-2025-10-11.md
review-architecture-2025-10-11.md
optimization-performance-2025-10-11.md

test-coverage-2025-10-11.md
```

## Report Types

### Sync Reports

**Generated By**: `/sync-repo` command

**Purpose**: Track repository synchronization - documentation updates, agent updates, command catalog updates

**Contents**:
- Documentation health check
- Agent configuration validation
- Command catalog synchronization
- Cross-reference validation
- Action items and recommendations

**Frequency**: After major feature implementations, quarterly maintenance

### Review Reports

**Generated By**: `/full-review`, `/architecture-review` commands

**Purpose**: Comprehensive code and architecture reviews

**Contents**:
- Code quality assessment
- Architectural decisions review
- Security analysis
- Performance considerations
- Refactoring recommendations

**Frequency**: Before major releases, after feature completion

### Optimization Reports

**Generated By**: `/optimize-performance`, specialized optimization agents

**Purpose**: Track performance improvements and code optimizations

**Contents**:
- Performance metrics (before/after)
- Optimization strategies applied
- Code quality improvements
- Type safety enhancements
- Bundle size reductions

**Frequency**: Ad-hoc, when performance issues identified

### Security Reports

**Generated By**: `/security-audit` command

**Purpose**: Security vulnerability assessment and compliance

**Contents**:
- Vulnerability scan results
- Security best practices compliance
- Authentication/authorization review
- Dependency vulnerability check
- Remediation recommendations

**Frequency**: Monthly, before production deployments

### Test Reports

**Generated By**: `/full-test`, `/improve-tests` commands

**Purpose**: Test coverage and quality analysis

**Contents**:
- Coverage metrics by module
- Missing test scenarios
- Flaky test identification
- Test quality assessment
- Improvement recommendations

**Frequency**: After major feature additions, sprint retrospectives

## Lifecycle

### 1. Generation

Reports are auto-generated by agents or slash commands:

```bash
/sync-repo              # Generates sync-repository-YYYY-MM-DD.md
/full-review            # Generates review-comprehensive-YYYY-MM-DD.md
/optimize-performance   # Generates optimization-performance-YYYY-MM-DD.md
/security-audit         # Generates security-audit-YYYY-MM-DD.md
```

### 2. Action

Review reports for action items:

```bash
# View latest sync report
cat .claude/reports/sync-repository-2025-10-11.md

# Extract action items
grep -A 3 "Action Items" .claude/reports/sync-repository-2025-10-11.md
```

### 3. Archive

After addressing action items, move to archive:

```bash
mv .claude/reports/sync-repository-2025-10-10.md \
   .claude/reports/archive/
```

### 4. Cleanup

Delete reports older than 90 days:

```bash
# Manual cleanup
find .claude/reports/archive/ -name "*.md" -mtime +90 -delete

# Or use automation (future)
.claude/scripts/cleanup-reports.sh
```

## Report vs Documentation

**Reports** (temporary, in `.claude/reports/`):
- Time-stamped, dated
- Auto-generated
- Point-in-time state
- NOT committed to git
- Archived after 90 days

**Documentation** (permanent, in `docs/`):
- Timeless (or updated as needed)
- Human-curated
- Describes how things work
- Committed to git
- Maintained indefinitely

**Decision Matrix**:
- Does it have a date? → Report
- Will it be useful in 6 months? → Documentation
- Is it auto-generated? → Report
- Does it describe what changed? → Report
- Does it describe how things work? → Documentation

## Quick Commands

### View Latest Reports

```bash
# List all reports (newest first)
ls -lt .claude/reports/*.md | head -10

# View latest sync report
cat .claude/reports/sync-repository-*.md | less

# Search for specific findings
grep -r "TODO" .claude/reports/
```

### Archive Old Reports

```bash
# Move specific report
mv .claude/reports/review-code-quality-2025-10-08.md \
   .claude/reports/archive/

# Move all reports from October
mv .claude/reports/*-2025-10-*.md .claude/reports/archive/
```

### Cleanup Old Archives

```bash
# List old reports (90+ days)
find .claude/reports/archive/ -name "*.md" -mtime +90

# Delete old reports
find .claude/reports/archive/ -name "*.md" -mtime +90 -delete
```

## Maintenance Schedule

### Weekly
- Review latest reports for action items
- Address high-priority findings

### Monthly
- Archive resolved reports
- Generate fresh sync and security reports
- Update related documentation in `docs/`

### Quarterly
- Delete reports older than 90 days
- Audit report usefulness
- Refine reporting standards
