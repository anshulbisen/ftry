## Migration Process

### Standard Migration Workflow

1. **Planning Phase**
   - Assess current state
   - Define desired end state
   - Identify risks and dependencies
   - Create rollback plan
   - Estimate effort and timeline

2. **Preparation Phase**
   - Set up test environment
   - Create migration scripts
   - Prepare monitoring and alerts
   - Document procedures
   - Review with team

3. **Execution Phase**
   - Perform migration in stages
   - Monitor closely during migration
   - Validate each stage
   - Document issues encountered
   - Update runbooks

4. **Validation Phase**
   - Verify functionality
   - Run test suites
   - Performance testing
   - Security validation
   - User acceptance testing

5. **Cleanup Phase**
   - Remove old infrastructure
   - Update documentation
   - Archive migration guide
   - Post-mortem analysis
   - Share lessons learned

### Migration Best Practices

**Planning**

- Start with comprehensive assessment
- Identify all dependencies
- Plan for the worst case
- Have a clear rollback strategy
- Communicate timeline to stakeholders

**Execution**

- Migrate in small, reversible steps
- Test thoroughly at each stage
- Monitor metrics continuously
- Keep detailed logs
- Be prepared to rollback

**Communication**

- Notify all stakeholders before migration
- Provide status updates during migration
- Document issues and resolutions
- Conduct post-migration review
- Share lessons learned

## Upcoming Migrations

### High Priority

**PII Encryption at Rest** (Planned for Q1 2025)

- Encrypt sensitive customer data in database
- Implement encryption key management
- Update application code for encrypt/decrypt
- Backfill existing data

**Email Service Migration** (Planned for Q1 2025)

- Move from simple SMTP to managed email service
- Implement email templates
- Add delivery tracking
- Set up bounce handling

### Medium Priority

**Multi-region Deployment** (Planned for Q2 2025)

- Deploy to multiple regions for low latency
- Implement geo-routing
- Set up cross-region data replication
- Handle data residency requirements

**Microservices Extraction** (Planned for Q3 2025)

- Extract background jobs to separate service
- Extract file upload service
- Extract notification service
- Maintain backward compatibility

### Low Priority

**Database Sharding** (Future)

- Shard by tenant ID for scale
- Implement shard routing
- Cross-shard queries
- Only needed at very high scale (1000+ tenants)

## Migration Risks

### Common Risks

**Data Loss**

- Mitigation: Comprehensive backups before migration
- Mitigation: Test migration on staging first
- Mitigation: Validate data integrity after migration

**Downtime**

- Mitigation: Plan migration during low-traffic periods
- Mitigation: Use blue-green deployment where possible
- Mitigation: Have rollback plan ready

**Performance Degradation**

- Mitigation: Performance testing before go-live
- Mitigation: Monitor metrics during migration
- Mitigation: Scale resources if needed

**Security Issues**

- Mitigation: Security review of migration plan
- Mitigation: Validate security controls after migration
- Mitigation: Run security scans post-migration

## Lessons Learned

### From CSRF Migration

‚úÖ **What Worked Well**

- Comprehensive testing in staging
- Clear documentation of changes
- Backward compatibility considerations
- Phased rollout approach

‚ö†Ô∏è **What Could Be Improved**

- Earlier performance testing
- More detailed rollback procedures
- Better communication of breaking changes

### From Grafana Cloud Migration

‚úÖ **What Worked Well**

- Cost analysis before migration
- Dashboard backup before migration
- Smooth integration with existing code
- Improved reliability and features

‚ö†Ô∏è **What Could Be Improved**

- More aggressive log filtering (cost)
- Better trace sampling strategy
- Earlier testing of alert rules
